# Countdown (Moj broj iz Slagalice)

## Description
This program is a math challenge game inspired by the "Numbers" round in the game show "Countdown." 
It generates six random numbers and presents the player with a target number. 
The player's goal is to use the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with the six numbers, to reach the target number. 
Each number may only be used once in the calculation, and the operations can be performed in any order. 
The player is also allowed to use brackets.
The game provides a fun and brain-teasing exercise in mental arithmetic and problem-solving.

## Program
This is a console program written in C++ which allows two players to play the game. The players enter their solutions, the computer evaluates them and then solves the problem on its own and 
presents the players with the solution.
